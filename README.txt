This application comes with 2 scripts. LCGP-compiled.pyw is version with the .ui file compiled and so it does not require the MainWindow.ui file anymore. the LCGP.pyw script does need it, but you can easily customize the ui with Designer. These 2 scripts are .pyw files. This means that the command prompt will be disabled when you run them. If you want to run the uncompiled version, please extract the archive to a folder. Make sure the .ui file is in the same directory as the script.

Packages required:
pip install PyQt5
pip install matplotlib
